# active-directory-homelab

## Overview:
This is a virtualized homelab where I used VirtualBox, Windows Server 2022, Windows 10 Pro to simulate a corporate Active Directory system. Below will be a loose step-by-step process of setting up the AD DS and its configurations.

## Installation and Setup:
- VMware/VirtualBox (I used VirtualBox)
- Windows 10 ISO File (free on Microsoft)
- Windows Server 2022 ISO File (Also free)
- 16 GB of RAM
- Recommended 100 GB of dedicated storage for the VMs

## Step 1: Setting Up VirtualBox
- Make sure you install VirtualBox or your preferred hypervisor.
- Install it and run VirtualBox

- Configure the name, select the correct ISO image, and make sure you select **Windows Server 2022 Desktop Experience** after you selected the Windows Server 2022 ISO image.
- Make sure you have enough RAM and Storage, I recommend 4 GB of RAM and 60 GBs of storage.

## Step 3: Run the VM
- The screen should bring you to the installation screen. This should take about 10-15 minutes and a product key is not needed as we are just using it as a homelab and a trial version will be used.
